Question 2: Easy Problems
Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

what is != and where should you use it?
	A "not equal comparison" Use it when you want to set a condition that is not equal to something.

2. put ! before something, like !user_name.
	This will give the boolean opposite.

3. put ! after something, like words.uniq!
	Generally but not always mutates the caller

4. put ? before something

5. put ? after something
	If x is ? (true or false) then ....

6. put !! before something, like !!user_name
	Diplays whether the variable is true or false
